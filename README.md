## Getting Started

Space Trucker Tools runs entirely in your browser—no installation required. Simply visit the [Space Trucker Tools homepage](https://spacetruckertools.servebeer.com/index.html) and select the tool you want from the dashboard. Each tool opens in its own page, with inputs, dropdowns, and buttons clearly labeled for quick use. Your data is stored locally in your browser, so you can close the page and return later without losing progress. For longer-term storage or sharing, most tools include options to export results to text, CSV, or directly to your clipboard.

---

## Usage Highlights

- **Dashboard navigation**: Launch and switch between tools instantly from the home screen.  
- **Export options**: Save manifests, log files, or profile data to clipboard or download for later reference.  
- **Dynamic feedback**: Calculations for yields, values, distances, and profit are displayed in real time.  
- **Persistent profiles**: Save your data between sessions by importing or exporting your profile settings.

## Future Work & Roadmap

- **Item Lookup & Scraper** (WIP): Add detailed item metadata and price scraping for dynamic value tracking.  
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Streamlined navigation, mobile responsiveness, and thematic styling for a cohesive experience.  
- **Data persistence**: Integrate local storage or backend database for long-term tracking across devices.  
- **New tools**: Potential addition of mining planner, route optimization, or faction-based modifiers.
